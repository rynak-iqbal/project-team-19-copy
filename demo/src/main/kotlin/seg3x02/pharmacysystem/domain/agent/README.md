# Agent Management Subdomain

**Type:** Supporting Domain

## Description

This subdomain manages pharmacy staff accounts including pharmacists, assistants, and administrators who operate the UYP-PMS system.

## Responsibilities

- Creating new agent accounts with initial credentials
- Managing agent profiles (names, email, roles)
- Updating agent information and passwords
- Deactivating agent accounts
- Role assignment (pharmacist, assistant, administrator)
- Tracking agent actions in prescription workflows

## Key Concepts

- Agent profiles (username, names, email, role)
- Account lifecycle (active, deactivated)
- Role-based access (Administrator, Pharmacist, Assistant)
- Credential management
- Initial password setup and mandatory password changes

## Supported Use Cases

- **Register Agent** (Priority 6)
- **Unregister Agent** (Priority 7)
- **Update Agent** (Priority 8)
- Supports all prescription workflow tracking by recording agent identities

## Rationale

This subdomain supports staff administration needs as the pharmacy workforce grows and changes. While not part of the core prescription business logic, proper agent management ensures accountability and traceability in prescription handling. Reusable solutions for user management likely exist, but customization is needed for pharmacy-specific roles and workflows.

## Dependencies

- Closely integrated with Authentication & Security for credential management
- Referenced by Prescription Management for audit trails
